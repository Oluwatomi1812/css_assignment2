        <p><b><i>My name is Oluwatomi Fowobaje and I was never really one for Technology. The world has always been crazy about technology but I never really understood the hype, 
            everyone wanted to learn how to code but it never really interested me. My mom came to me and started telling me about how technology 
            is where the future is heading and how I needed to get with the times, so against my will she enrolled me for a summer coding program,
            where I learnt Python at beginner's level. To my suprise, I really enjoyed the program, it was actually so much fun. I was never interested 
            in technology but now if I'm not coding it feels like something is wrong. I grew to really love technology and coding and it has become a passion of mine
            so much so that I have chosen to study it in University.

            <p>Over the past few weeks we have certainly learnt a lot. To quickly summarize, we learnt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Git: The version control system that provides an automatic way to track changes in software projects. 
                    Learning the basic command like git add, git commit, git pull, git push and so on.
                </li>
                <li>HTML: The building block of a webpage. Using HTML tags to create list, forms, tables, adding images, audios, videos.</li>
                <li>CSS: This is used to style an HTML document. There are serval ways to add CSS to an HTML document; External, Internal and Inline Styling. 
                    There are 5 CSS Selectors; Element, ID, Class and Attribute Selectors. The styles that can be added are Colour, Background, Border, Margin, Padding, Float, Flexbox and many more.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why CSS so important?</p>
            <p>CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. It designs your page to give it a more appealing look. But CSS doesn't just design, 
                it also helps you to move/format elements to a desired location.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Padding: The padding creates space around elements. </li>
                <li>Border: The border is the space between the padding and margin.</li>
                <li>Margin: The margin is used to generate a space around the elements.</li>
